:wave: Hi there, and welcome to the SparkPost community! I'm Sparky, your friendly Slackbot, and I'm here to give you a quick tour so you feel a little more at home.

Start off in the #community channel. Feel free to introduce yourself... we're a friendly crew :) Tell us who you are and where you're from, or just wave hello. We'd love to get to know you!

If you've got a general question about getting started with SparkPost, head over to #support. Someone there will be able to help you, or at least point you in the right direction.

Know exactly what topic you need help with? Take a look at the list of channels -- you just may find the one you're looking for! Whether you'll find a droid there is another question entirely.

If you can't find the droid, er, topic you're looking for, feel free to create a new channel, and then alert a few people to it. Chances are, there are other people interested in that same topic who would be more than willing to join you. Keep in mind that public channels are always preferred to private. For other witty suggestions on how to best use Slack channels, see [Emily Post's Unofficial Guide to Slack Etiquette](https://github.com/SparkPost/slack-etiquette).

No matter if you need a question answered, want to share what you're working on, or simply want a place to hang out, please keep our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SparkPost/sparkpost.github.io/blob/develop/CodeofConduct.md) in mind at all times. tl;dr: Be respectful, and if someone makes you uncomfortable, let us know.

That's all for now! But if you have any questions, holler at me, and keep your eyes peeled for the occasional easter egg.

Cheers!

:sparky:
